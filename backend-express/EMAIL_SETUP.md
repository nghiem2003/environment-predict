## Automatic Notifications

The system automatically sends email notifications when:

1. **New Prediction**: When a new prediction is created for an area
2. **Prediction Results**: Includes prediction result and model used
3. **Unsubscribe Link**: Each email contains a link to unsubscribe

### Email Template

The notification emails include:

- Area name and type
- Prediction result and model used
- Link to view prediction details
- Unsubscribe link for easy opt-out
- Professional HTML formatting
- Vietnamese language support

## Error Handling

- Email sending failures are logged but don't interrupt the main operations
- Duplicate email-area pairs are prevented
- Invalid email formats are validated
- Missing required fields return appropriate error messages

## Security

- Email routes require authentication
- Different authorization levels for different operations
- Email credentials are stored in environment variables
- Input validation and sanitization

## Frontend Components

### EmailSubscription

- Simple form for users to subscribe to prediction notifications
- Built with Ant Design components (Card, Form, Input, Button, Alert)
- Email validation and error handling
- Success/error feedback

### UnsubscribePage

- Handles unsubscribe requests via token
- Modern UI with Ant Design Result component
- Loading states and error handling
- Area information display

### EmailList (Admin)

## Troubleshooting

1. **Email not sending**: Check your email credentials and app password
2. **Database errors**: Ensure the migration has been run
3. **Authentication errors**: Verify JWT token and user permissions
4. **Duplicate subscriptions**: The system prevents duplicate email-area pairs
5. **UI issues**: Ensure Ant Design is properly installed and imported
